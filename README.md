CLegans - A package for writing high-performance Ace.OpenCL-based simulations

**Q**: What kind of simulations?
**A**: Currently, CLegans focuses on spiking neural circuit simulations, but there is nothing preventing you from doing other step-based (rather than event-based) simulations straightforwardly.

**Q**: What's with the name?
**A**: CLegans is named after (and pronounced like) c. elegans, a tiny nematode worm with the distinction of being the only organism with a fully-mapped nervous system.
